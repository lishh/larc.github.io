Iâ€™m currently a lecturer in Computer Science at La Salle University. I earned my BSc degree in computer science from the National University of Saint Augustine, Arequipa - Peru and my MSc degree in computer science from Federal Fluminense University, Niteroi - Brazil.
I am interested in geometry processing, shape analysis, machine learning, and computer vision. I also have an interest in algorithms, data structures and problem-solving.

## gproshan (geometry processing and shape analysis framework)

![](../images/gproshan.png)

Gproshan is a framework, which contains some algorithms of Geometry Processing and Shape Analysis. We are developing this framework with [Luciano](https://larc.github.io/) as part of our graduate research.
See our [repository](https://github.com/larc/gproshan) and [publications](publications.md) for more information.
