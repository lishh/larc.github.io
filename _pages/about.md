I am a Ph.D. student at the Visualization and MultiMedia Lab of the University of Zurich, working as an Early-Stage Researcher in the H2020 MSCA-ITN project EVOCATION, in the problem of indoor reconstruction of scenes.  
I am proud of being awarded the GHC 2020 scholarship to attend the largest gathering of women in technology, known as the Grace Hopper Celebration.
 I earned my BSc degree in computer science from the National University of Saint Augustine, Arequipa - Peru, and my MSc degree in computer science from Federal Fluminense University, Niteroi - Brazil.
My research interests are geometry processing, shape analysis, machine learning, and computer vision.
